            Charisma Jamison's journey with Cole began when she was working as a rehabilitation technician at Sheltering
            Arms Physical Rehabilitation. With her passion for helping others and her vibrant personality, she connected
            with Cole during his therapy sessions, not knowing that this professional relationship would blossom into
            something more meaningful.

            Since the start of our relationship, we've received many questions about how we make things work as an
            interracial and interabled couple. Despite our differences, we have a great time, all the time! We started
            our vlog to bring people into our lives and raise awareness about accessibility and dating in a wheelchair.
